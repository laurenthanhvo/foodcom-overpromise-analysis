  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    In today’s world of food blogging and recipe sharing, authors often use enthusiastic marketing-style language—words like “delicious,” “amazing,” and “you will LOVE this”—to entice home cooks to try their creations.  However, some recipes hyped in their descriptions fail to live up to expectations, receiving low ratings despite the promise of “deliciousness.”
  </p>
  <p>
    In this project, we analyze a dataset of <strong>83,782</strong> recipes scraped from Food.com to answer the question:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <strong>Can we detect, based solely on a recipe’s publish-time attributes (ingredients, steps, nutrition, and description text), when a recipe author has overpromised and home cooks end up rating it poorly?</strong>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    Understanding this “mismatch” between marketing language and actual user satisfaction can help recipe platforms flag recipes likely to disappoint, improve recommendation engines, and guide authors toward more honest, data-driven descriptions.

  <h3>Dataset Overview</h3>
  <p>
    Our merged dataset contains <strong>83,782</strong> rows.  For this prediction problem, we focus on the following columns:
  </p>
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Column Name</th>
        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><code>description</code></td>
        <td>Original text description written by the recipe author.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>avg_rating</code></td>
        <td>Average user rating (1–5 stars); recipes without ratings are marked missing.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>n_ingredients</code></td>
        <td>Number of ingredients listed in the recipe.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>n_steps</code></td>
        <td>Number of preparation steps.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>minutes</code></td>
        <td>Estimated total cook + prep time in minutes.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>calories</code></td>
        <td>Total calories per serving.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>protein_g</code></td>
        <td>Grams of protein per serving.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>carbs_g</code></td>
        <td>Grams of carbohydrates per serving.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>tag_list</code></td>
        <td>List of categorical tags (e.g., “vegetarian”, “dessert”).</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>desc_has_delicious</code></td>
        <td>Boolean flag: whether the description contains the word “delicious.”</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>mismatch</code></td>
        <td>Target label: 1 if <code>desc_has_delicious</code> is true but <code>avg_rating</code> &lt; 4; otherwise 0.</td>
      </tr>
