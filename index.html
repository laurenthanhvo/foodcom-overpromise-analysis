    Recipes often promise “delicious” meals, but sometimes home-cooked versions fall short. Our project,
    <strong>“Mismatch Detector: Are Home Cooks Experiencing Recipes as Intended?”</strong>, builds a
    statistical model to automatically flag recipes whose marketing language (“delicious” in the
    description) fails to match actual cook ratings (average rating &lt; 4.0). By leveraging recipe
    metadata, nutritional features, and user interactions, we aim to predict which recipes are likely to
    disappoint—so that home cooks will know ahead of time.

    In modern cooking communities, many recipes are shared online with enthusiastic descriptions.
    Phrases like “best ever” or “so delicious” set high expectations, but every home cook’s experience can
    vary. Our core question is:
  </p>
  <blockquote class="section__quote">
    <strong>
      Can we detect, based solely on the recipe’s publish-time attributes (ingredients, steps, nutrition,
      and description text), when a recipe’s author overpromises and home cooks end up rating it poorly?
    </strong>
  </blockquote>
  <p class="section__text">
    To answer this, we:
  </p>
  <ol class="section__list">
    <li>Merge the “recipes” and “interactions” datasets to compute average ratings per recipe.</li>
    <li>Define a binary “mismatch” target: when a recipe’s description contains “delicious” but its
      average rating is below 4.0.</li>
    <li>Engineer features such as number of ingredients/steps, cook time, and nutritional ratios.</li>
    <li>Train and compare baseline and final classifiers to predict mismatches.</li>
    <li>Assess statistical fairness to ensure our detector works equally well across recipe types.</li>
  </ol>
  <p class="section__text">
    In the following sections, we walk through each step of the data science lifecycle—exploratory
    analysis, missingness assessment, hypothesis testing, modeling, and fairness—to build a robust
    “Mismatch Detector” and demonstrate how it can help home cooks avoid disappointing recipes.
